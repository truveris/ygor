# TODO
 - rename alias.Name to alias.Key?
 - send the capabilities to the master
 - implement volume as a stateful system (pass the volume to all the players)
 - implement a temporary and permanent voting system.
    - permanent would be something like "Light in the engineering room" and you can change your opinion constantly.
    - temporary would be "Should we go get cheese steak sandwiches for lunch?".
    - one could address the butler this way: "vote light on"
    - one could request a vote status with "vote light"
    - you can create a new poll with "add-vote http://stuff/vote-config.json"
 - make AliasFile and MinionsFile thread safe.
 - Validate the configuration (e.g. minion name should be [a-z0-9]+..)
 - LogFile parameter to dump everything to disk as well.
 - Imdb module (find film, get title from URL, etc.)
 - Count how many people are online.

# test:
#  - toggle function
#  - unknown chatter
#  - unknown command
#  - ignore private content
#  - multiple commands (;)
#  - unconfigured channel command?
#  - unable to load minion queue url
#  - error loading files (minions, aliases)
#  - recursive in multi-commands, in random
